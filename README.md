### Group Frame
- Colors
  - Red: Everyone is missing buffs
  - Yellow: Some are missing buffs
  - Green: Everyone is buffed
  - Players that are dead, offline or not in render range during combat will be ignored
- Number bottom center is the group number
- Yellow number right of the buff icon indicates how many people are missing that buff
- Duration displays the lowest duration in that group

Clicking on the group frame will rotate its target through the group members on each click. It ignores people that are out of range, dead, afk or offline.

### Player Frame
- `R` is the range indicator
  - Green: In range
  - Yellow: Out of spell range but in render range
  - Red: Out of range
- `D` indicates that player is dead
- `OFF` indicates that the player is offline
- Tanks have a shield icon
- Duration of `00:00` means the target has the buff but the client does not supply its duration, usually happens when the target is not in render range
